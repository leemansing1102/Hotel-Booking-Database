# üè® Hotel Reservation System Database

## üåü Project Overview
This project involves designing a relational database system for hotel management, aimed at efficiently handling customer bookings, room assignments, payments, and housekeeping tasks. It provides a scalable solution that supports both individual and group reservations, helping hotels streamline operations, reduce errors, and improve overall efficiency.


## üéØ Business Problem
Hotels often face challenges managing bookings, ensuring accurate payment tracking, and efficiently allocating housekeeping resources. This system is designed to solve these challenges by:

-‚Ä¢ **Peak Demand Management**: Tracks room availability in real time to prevent double bookings and optimize occupancy during busy periods.
*‚Ä¢ **Accurate Payment Tracking**: Automates payment processing, ensuring real-time, error-free financial reporting.
+‚Ä¢ **Housekeeping Efficiency**: Automates housekeeping schedules, reducing room turnover time and improving operational efficiency.

## üîë Key Features
‚Ä¢ **Customer Management & Reservation Management**: Efficiently tracks customer data, preferences, and multiple reservations.
‚Ä¢ **Room Assignments**: Real-time tracking of room availability and status.
‚Ä¢ **Payments**: Integrated payment processing and recording.
‚Ä¢ **Housekeeping Assignments**: Streamlined housekeeping and maintenance scheduling.

## üõ†Ô∏è Database Structure
The database is built around seven main entities:

‚Ä¢ Customers: Stores customer details, preferences, and history.
‚Ä¢ Reservations: Tracks bookings, check-in/check-out dates, and group reservations.
‚Ä¢ Payments: Manages transaction records related to reservations.
‚Ä¢ Hotel Rooms: Contains information on room types, statuses, and availability.
‚Ä¢ Employees: Stores data about hotel staff, including those responsible for cleaning.
‚Ä¢ Housekeeping Assignments: Records which employees clean specific rooms and the status of these tasks.
‚Ä¢¬†Group Reservations: Manages larger bookings with multiple rooms and special requests.

## [üß† SQL Queries & Analysis] ()
Here are a few examples of the SQL queries used in the project to address specific business problems:

‚Ä¢ **Room Availability**:

>SELECT room_id, status FROM hotelrooms WHERE status = 'available' ORDER BY room_type;

_Insight: This query helps track which rooms are available for new bookings, allowing for efficient room allocation._

‚Ä¢ **High-Value Reservations:**

>SELECT customer_id, reservation_id, amount 
>FROM payments 
>WHERE amount >= 400 
>ORDER BY amount DESC;

_Insight: This query identifies high-value customers, useful for targeted marketing and promotions._

‚Ä¢ **Peak Booking Insights**:

>SELECT reservation_id, MAX(check_out - check_in) AS stay_duration 
>FROM reservations 
>GROUP BY reservation_id 
>HAVING stay_duration > 5 
>ORDER BY stay_duration DESC;

_Insight: Helps identify guests with long stays, allowing the hotel to provide better service and plan staffing accordingly._

## üìä Key Insights from the Project
‚Ä¢ **Optimized Room Allocation**: By tracking room availability in real-time, the system helps minimize double bookings and ensures optimal room usage.
‚Ä¢ **Improved Revenue Tracking**: Automated payment reconciliation processes reduce errors, helping hotels track revenue more effectively.
‚Ä¢ **Housekeeping Efficiency**: Automated task assignment improves room turnover times, making rooms available for new guests faster.

## üîç Challenges Addressed
‚Ä¢ **Data Integrity**: Ensured that customer and reservation data is consistent and accurate, particularly when handling group bookings.
‚Ä¢ **Scalability**: Designed the system to scale easily, whether for a small boutique hotel or a large chain, without sacrificing performance.
‚Ä¢ **Complex Queries**: Addressed the need for complex reporting (e.g., long-stay guests, high-value reservations) through advanced SQL queries.

## üíª Technology Stack
‚Ä¢ **Database:** MySQL
‚Ä¢ **Tools**: SQL for query optimization, data retrieval, and business reporting.
